# 2017 OpenGL Projects
A series of projects I'm doing as I learn OpenGL through learnopengl.com

## Hello Triforce

My first OpenGL project, taken from carefully following the tutorial from: [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/#!Getting-started/Hello-Triangle)
            
### Key Commands:   
    1. Press "1", "2", "3", or "4" to change between triangle colors    
        1 = blue    
        2 = yellow  
        3 = red 
        4 = interpolated    
    2. Press "w", "a", or "d" to change between triangles   
        w = top triangle    
        a = left triangle   
        d = right triangle  
    3. Press "p" to go to polygon mode and "f" to go to fill mode for all triangles 
    4. Press and hold "b" to gradually change the saturation of all triangles
